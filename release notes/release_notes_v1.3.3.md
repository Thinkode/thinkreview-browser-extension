## 🎯 What's New

### Smart Media File Filtering 🖼️

Your AI code reviews just got smarter! ThinkReview now automatically filters out media and binary files from merge requests, ensuring the AI focuses only on your actual code changes:

- **Automatic Detection**: Images, videos, GIFs, PDFs, fonts, and other non-code files are intelligently excluded from reviews
- **Better Focus**: AI reviews concentrate on code logic, security, and best practices rather than media content
- **Faster Reviews**: Smaller patches mean quicker processing and faster results
- **Transparent Process**: You'll see a clear note when media files are excluded from the review
- **Cost Efficient**: Reduces unnecessary AI processing for better resource optimization

**Example:**
When your merge request includes code changes plus images or videos, you'll see:
```
Note: 2 media/binary files (logo.png, demo.mp4) were excluded from the review.
```

**Supported File Types:**
Images (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.) • Videos (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.) • Documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) • Fonts (TTF, WOFF, etc.) • Archives (ZIP, TAR, etc.) • Audio files and more
